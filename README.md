I'm Fabiano [fa\.biˈɐ.nu] and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm passionate about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software Engineering (SE).

🔭 I’m currently working on the development and maintenance of Java-based software for the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil.

🎓 I'm a highly motivated Professional Msc Student in Electrical Engineering at University of Brasília - UnB/Brazil. My research focuses on the use of Machine Unlearning (MU) techniques in large language model (LLM) to mitigate biases with the aim of promoting safety and fairness in AI applications and with practical implications in several areas.
